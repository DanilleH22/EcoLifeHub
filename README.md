* The navigation at the top and in the footer has been tested to make sure it clicks to the page been shown.

When testing the website I had run into the issue of the images being used not being responsive. This was fixed by changing images from jpg to webp and including a fixed height and width in the HTML code. 

Another bug that I ahd faced was when trying to get my about sections to be responsive, photos and irames would not go horizontal. This was fixed by using 'grid-template-column' in css and 'order'.

Another issue faced was when the website was deployed it would not show the picture images on the website, only the alt would show up. This was fixed by removing the '/' before all images. 

A bug that had been found is the submit form would not submit anywhere. An action and method was added to form however still it did not submit. In the end a thank you page was created and linked in form element, which also links back to the homepage. 

### Validator Testing 

Validator testing has been conducted to find any errors on the website.
 
* When passing through W3C HTML Validator, no errors were returned.
* When passing through W3C CSS Validation tester no errors were returned.
