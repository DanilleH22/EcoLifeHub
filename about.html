                <h2>Hi, we are... EcoLifeHub</h2>
                <p>
                    At EcoLifeHub we believe that creating a better future for us and the next generation starts with living a sustainable life. 
                    We created this website with the intention of raising awareness. To do this the website gives users information and resources, 
                    whilst inspiring them to take action throughout their life.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The definition of sustainable according to the dictionary is ‘conserving an ecological balance by avoiding depletion of natural 
                    resources’. To be sustainable we have to find the balance between, economic prosperity, environmental preservation and social equity. 
                    By being sustainable we are able to notice how our actions throughout the day effects our resources, Earth and everyone around us.
